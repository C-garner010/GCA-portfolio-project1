Over the rest of the summer, and during my exploration w this next part of the class, I will continue to add what I've learned and make sure I tailor it to match my site and needs. 
    
    Some of the things I will continue to work on when granted with more time and patience would be perfecting my nav bar, working on expanding my understanding and comprehension of the bootstrap grid system for responsive layout, and beginning to work on properly structuring link connections. -->

      <!-- I tried to get this image carousel to work multiple times and could not get the image to move off the first one in any instance. This was the closest I could get to without the photos blowing way out of proportion. I don't understand why it won't scroll, especially because I even went into inspect and console to see if it could find any errors, and they could not. 
      
      When I continue to add to this site, and refine the development throughout the rest of the summer, I will probably change the carousel to something else, but in the mean time this is all I could think to work with for now! -->
